				I'm a senior in computer science at Purdue University.  
				I enjoy everything soccer, playing guitar, and being mediocre at video games.
				<br>
				<br>
				This past summer, I had the opportunity to work with <a href="https://www.pfl.com">PFL.com</a>
				as part of the <a href="https://techpoint.org/xtern/">Xtern</a> program in Indianapolis.  My role 
				as an intern consisted of designing and completing an internal tool for the use of the software
				team.  I utilized .NET Core along with Azure Service Bus, Azure Functions, and MongoDB to build
				my summer project.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm currently looking for a full-time job as a software developer.

					Quack is a web/mobile application a team and I developed for a software engineering course in 2018.
					The goal of the project was to create a modern way of take attendance and quizzes in class.
					We accomplished this by creating a web application for teachers to create classes
					and quizzes along with a mobile application for students to enroll and take attendance in class.
					We used React and React Native for the frontend of our applications along with a Node.js server 
					connected to an SQL database with Apollo/GraphQL for our backend.

					Eat Out is a cross-platform mobile app that my friends and I made in the summer of 2017.
					It allows a group of people to find restaurants based on everyone's food preferences 
					and hold a vote on where to eat. Once a restaurant has been picked, the app shows directions, 
					estimated travel time, and a link to their Yelp page.
